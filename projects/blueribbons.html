					<p class="lead font-weight-bold"><u>Overview</u></p>
					<p class="lead">I worked on an MVC application that was designed to promote discounted products. I was involved with the front-end of the project - which entailed modifing or creating bootstrap components and writing CSS when needed. In addition, I also implemented other back-end facing features.</p>

					<p class="lead font-weight-bold"><u>Front-End</u></p>
					<p class="lead">Design work was focused around extending the existing thematic structure of the site, as well as creating new functionality such as drop-down menus. I debugged and fixed CSS code that was causing several pages to be incorrectly formatted. </p>
					<p class="lead">Part of the work involved both skill sets. For example, creating good end user feedback during input validation methods. This required writing new code in the views, controllers, and data models. Additionally, LINQ queries were used to create tables and lists of products based on user selected filters from drop-down menus. This, in an MVC framework, required changes to be made to both the view and controller.</p>

				<div class="col-sm">
					<p class="lead font-weight-bold"><u>Back-End</u></p>
					<p class="lead">My work on the back-end was more in-depth and substantial than the front-end. I started with validating user input, which was a multi-step process.</p>
					<p class="lead">The first step I took was to add data annotations to the model itself in order to make sure database integrity was secure, and to modify some display names to be end-user friendly. Next, I modified the controller action result methods to ensure proper data binding was occuring before finally adding more helpful display text to the views so the end-user was probably informed about what was expected of them.</p>

				<div class="col-sm">
					<p class="lead">Another task that I worked on involved the automation of emailing. The user filled out a number of web-forms, from which the system would generate, format, and send an email. First I grabbed the currently logged in users information. Next created validation methodologies as described previously. The user needed to provide a real email address, and some kind of message to go along with it. I put to use the aptly named .Net library 'Mail' to work, closely following documentation guidelines. Part of the functionality required that I setup an email server to send the actual emails through.</p>

					<p class="lead">The client wanted to use gmail so I researched gmail's SMTP and coded in the host's information. Once everthimg was done, I tested the code by sending a series emails from the application, ensuring that it not only worked, but met the requiments of it.</p>

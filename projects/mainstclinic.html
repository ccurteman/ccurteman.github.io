					<p class="lead">This project was built for a client in order to track patient symptoms with assosciated health recommendations. I built the project from conception to implementation. The application to connected to a Sql Server relational database. The project was built with a database first approach, with the models being generated directly from the database.</p>

				<div class="col-sm">
					<p class="lead">The first step in the project involved the creation of a database system. I started with the needs of the client - what needed to be tracked, how the different data would correspond with each other, etc. From there a database was protyped and tested. After the needs of the client were met by the database, the database was normalized (at least through the 3rd normal form).</p>
					<p class="lead">Once the database was built, and I was confident it would only need minor adjustements, the focus of the project switched to the front-end.</p>

					<p class="lead">The application was built using a .Net MVC structure. There were two main focal points for this step of the project. Firstly, to create a framework that would allow the client's office to easily manipulate data while maintaining database integrity. And secondly, to take that data and relate it to the physician in such a way that is useful and informative.</p>
